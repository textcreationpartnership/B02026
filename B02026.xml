            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas, by the Lawes of this Land, the Ordering and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom, for the preventing and ſuppreſſion of all Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Rebellions, hath (as a moſt known and undoubted Right and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative) belonged in all time ſolely to Our Self and Our Progenitors, Kings of <hi>England.</hi> And accordingly We have heretofore awarded Commiſſions of Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancy into the ſeverall Counties of this Our Realm, for the governing and exerciſing of the Souldiorie and Trained Bands there, like as Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and Our dear Father, both of happy memorie, had done before Vs. And therein (amongſt other things) gave power to the Commiſſioners in each Countie, to Leavie, call together, Arm, Array, Train, and Muſter our Subjects inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſaid ſeverall Counties, and to Conduct and lead them againſt all Our Enemies, and all Rebels and Traitors from time to time, as often as need ſhould require.</p>
            <p>All which Commiſſions (although We did, ſince the beginning of this Parliament, grant the like for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>York,</hi> to the now Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> with the privitie of both Our Houſes of Parliament, and without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from either) have, without hearing any of Our Councell learned, been ſince Voted in Our ſaid Houſes of Parliament to be illegall and void; the reaſon whereof We have not yet been informed of, nor can imagine: For that neither any illegall Clauſe (if any ſuch be) in thoſe Commiſſions, nor any exceſſe or abuſe of their Authority, by any Lieutenants or their Deputies, in raiſing of moneys, taxing of the inhabitants, or otherwiſe could, by Law, make void any ſuch Powers as in themſelves were lawfull to be granted and put in execution.</p>
            <p>And whereas, in caſes of danger and neceſſity, it had been more ſutable to the condition of the times, and the good liking of Our Subjects (who cannot be well pleaſed with any new wayes, how ſpecious ſoever) that Our Houſes of Parliament ſhould have taken Order that Our Commiſſions of Lieutenancie (the Courſe whereof had ſo long continued) ſhould, for the preſent, have been put in execution, at leaſtwiſe ſuch part thereof as was undeniably and unqueſtionably legall, and was ſufficient for the purpoſes before mentioned, or that (according to the like Preſidents in former times) they would have deſired Vs to have granted new Commiſſions of that nature, omitting ſuch clauſes as might juſtly have been excepted againſt, which We would not have denied, and not to have called in ſo ſuddenly for thoſe Commiſſions to be cancelled, as was done (though We know not by what Law) in Our Houſe of Peers. Yet notwithſtanding, Our two Houſes of Parliament, in ſtead of ſuch Our Commiſſions, under pretence of evident and imminent danger, and urgent and inevitable neceſſity of putting Our Subjects into a Poſture of Defence, have made a late Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfor the ſetling of the <hi>Militia,</hi> under the name of an Ordinance (which two or three ſeverall times had been refuſed by the major part of Peers) and being made, not only without, but againſt Our Conſent (the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whereof are ſufficiently known to all Our Subjects) is not onely without any one warrantable Preſident of former times (as we beleeve) but (as We are well aſſured) void in Law.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, out of the care which We have of Our people, leſt under the pretence of danger, neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and want of Authoritie from Vs to put them into a Militarie Poſture, they ſhould be drawn and ingaged in

               </gap>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> Our ſeverall Commiſſions of Array; thereby giving power to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Perſons of Honour, Reputation and Eſtate in the ſaid Counties, for the ſafetie and defence of Vs, Our Kingdom, and Our good Subjects from time to time, as it ſhall be needfull to Array, Train, Arm, and Muſter Our Subjects inhabiting in the ſaid Counties, and in caſe of imminent danger to conduct and lead them for the deſtruction of Our Enemies, and in the defence of their Countrey and the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Which power of granting Commiſſions for the defence of Vs and Our Kingdoms, as it is inherent in Vs, and inſeparable from Our Crown, ſo it hath been warranted by Preſidents of the like Commiſſions in all Ages, both before and ſince the grant of the great Charter by King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, down to the very time that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of Lieutenancie were granted, and was agreeed to be legall even by the two learned Iudges, Sir <hi>George Crook,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Hutton,</hi> (amongſt all the reſt) in their Arguments, which concluded on the Subjects part in Our Exchequer-Chamber in Maſter <hi>Hampdens</hi> Caſe, as by the ſame (now ſince printed) may appear, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with divers particular Records in ſeverall Ages therein mentioned, to which many more may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>And in theſe Our Commiſſions, to prevent all manner of Exception, We have, in the powers given to Our Commiſſioners, in all points followed that Commiſſion of Array, which was agreed upon by the King and both Houſes of Parliament, after conference with the Iudges of the Realm, in the fifth yeer of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and was done upon the deſire of the Commons, to have ſome alterations from former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions in certain overſtrict Clauſes, whereunto nevertheleſſe no exception was taken for the legalitie, but the Kings Aſſent acknowledged as an Act of great Grace, as appeareth by the Parliament Rolls of that yeer. Since which time Commiſſions of Array have frequently iſſued for prevention of danger, either of Enemies abroad or at home (in both which reſpects Our Houſes of Parliament have voted this Kingdom to be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) the ſame being indeed the old ordinary way for the preſervation of the King and Kingdom, who muſt not delay their preparation till ſuch danger break forth into Action, and ſo perhaps prove too late. And theſe Commiſſions of Array were not diſcontinued, till by reaſon of the Commiſſions of Lieutenancie (which in ſubſtance contained the powers given by thoſe Commiſſions of Array) they came to be of little uſe.</p>
            <p>And, whereas by the Statute of the fourth and fifth yeers of the Reign of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> King and Queen of <hi>England,</hi> it is enacted, That if any perſon or perſons that ſhall be commanded generally or ſpecially to Muſter afore any ſuch as ſhall have Authority or Commandment for the ſame, by, or from the King, or by any Lieutenant, Warden, or other perſon or perſons authorized for the ſame, do willingly abſent him or themſelves from the ſame M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Which Statute is in full force.</p>
            <p>We do therefore, by this Our Proclamation, expreſly charge and command all Our Sheriffs, Iuſtices of Peace, Majors, Bailiffs, Conſtables, and all other Our Officers, and other Our loving Subjects of Our ſeverall Counties of <hi>England,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales</hi> reſpectively, That they be attending, aiding, aſſiſting, counſelling, and at the commandment of the ſaid Commiſſioners of Our ſeverall Counties reſpectively in the execution of their Commiſſions, as they will anſwer the contrary at their utmoſt perils.</p>
